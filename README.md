## About Me as Web Dev.

I design & build responsive web apps from scratch; from the Database & RESTful( sometimes GraphQL) API through to the UI.

Three (3)+ years of extensive professional experience and skills in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery (including jQuery Ajax), Bootstrap 3 (up to Bootstrap5), Node.js, React.js and Python (Django) has taught me to always pay keen attention to details & to follow certain clean code conventions.

I also have working knowledge of design tools such as Illustrator and Photoshop which are evident in my <a href="https://www.hire-pius.com/graphics/" target="_blank">graphics design portfolio</a>. Other web technologies I have mastered are shown in the stack section.
