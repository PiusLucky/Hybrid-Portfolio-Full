## About JointAccessProgrammer.com

Creating web interfaces, APIs, Backends, Algorithms, Scripts are insanely fun and satisfying, but can be difficult as well. Our main goal is to break down these heinous tasks simply plain.

## Available Categories

### User Interface / User Experience
UI/UX brings boring codes to live, it comes first, a project with proper visualization is way respected compared to another with saggy visuals. We intend making you a UI Expert.

### Backend
The userface is nothing without a clean and functional backend. The complexities and logic behind the scenes as well as building <code>APIS</code> which are wired with server-side programming languages like Python, NodeJS, ReactJS..

### Algorithms, ML
There has to be a way to get the job done, not just finding the way but also putting effectiveness and efficiency forward. Machine learning algorithms are best for stand-alone actions taken without explicitly instructing the computer to do so.

### Free Projects (+ source code )
We offer majority of our projects for free with all source codes available on github for download. Specifically meant for non-patreons.


### Premium
Premium projects consist of all project materials, source codes, prototypes. Cheapest hosting ideas and domain name purchases for our patreons who also get access to sensitive materials as well as 24/7 support from our dedicated team of software engineers.


## Color Scheme

```json

  "Xiketic": "#0f1020"
  "Pure white": #fff
  "Wheat": #efd6ac
```
